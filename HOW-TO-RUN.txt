2. Press F5 or click "Run" -> "Start Debugging"
3. Application will launch


================================================================================
                        TEST USER CREDENTIALS

                      WHAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

✅ COMPLETED:
-------------
1. Login Screen (UC1 - Register/Login)
   - Email and password validation
   - Mock authentication
   - Navigation to dashboards based on role

4. CSS Styling: Professional look and feel


📋 STILL TO BE BUILT:
--------------------
1. Register Screen (UC1)

4. Search Properties Screen (UC2)
5. Property Details Screen (UC3)
6. Booking Request Screen (UC4)
7. Host Bookings Screen (UC6 - Approve/Decline)
8. Add Property Screen (UC8)
9. Additional screens for other use cases


================================================================================
                         TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "javac is not recognized"
Solution: Make sure Java JDK is installed and added to PATH

Problem: Application doesn't start
Solution:
  1. Run compile.bat first
  2. Make sure JavaFX libraries are in lib/ folder
  3. Check if Java version is 11 or higher

Problem: CSS not loading
Solution: Resources are automatically copied during compilation

Problem: FXML not found
Solution: Make sure bin/ui/views/ contains .fxml files


================================================================================
                        NEXT STEPS FOR YOU
================================================================================

1. Test the login screen with the mock credentials above
2. Verify navigation works (should show error "Dashboard not implemented")
3. Once confirmed working, continue building remaining screens:
   - Register
   - Guest Dashboard
   - Host Dashboard
   - Search Properties
   - Property Details
   - Booking Request
   - Host Bookings
   - Add Property

4. When Ibrahim provides his business logic classes, replace the mock
   authentication in LoginController.java with real service calls


================================================================================
                          IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

⚠️ The current implementation uses MOCK DATA for testing
⚠️ Real business logic will be provided by Ibrahim (Business Logic Layer)
⚠️ Real database connectivity will be provided by Omer (Database Layer)
⚠️ Your job is to build the complete UI layer and connect it later

✨ Focus on making the UI look professional and easy to use
✨ Apply GRASP patterns in your controllers (already done in LoginController)
✨ Keep controllers clean - only handle UI logic, not business logic
✨ Document your code with comments explaining GRASP patterns used


================================================================================
                       READY TO TEST YOUR APP!
================================================================================

Run: compile-and-run.bat

The login screen should appear with:
- Saraye logo and title
- Email and password fields
- Login button
- Register link (not yet implemented)
- Professional styling

Try logging in with guest@saraye.com / password123

Good luck with your SDA project! 🚀
